[Logstash](http://logstash.net/) is a fantastic tool for processing logs
and making the information contained in them useful. One of the ways
this happens is via
[Grok](http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/wiki/Grok) patterns. This
repo is me starting to collect useful patterns. Currently this
repository contains patterns for:

* [Lograge](https://github.com/roidrage/lograge) - making Rails logs suck less
* [lighttpd](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs_ModAccesslog) - default lighttpd accesslog format

## Tests

[![Build

[![Dependency
Status](https://gemnasium.com/garethr/logstash-patterns.png)](http://gemnasium.com/garethr/logstash-patterns)

As well as being a set of patterns for people to use in logstash, this
repo also contains test suites for those patterns and a rspec matcher
that might be useful to anyone else who wants to write and test grok
patterns. You can run the test suite with:

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake
